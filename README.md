# boolfab

Fabric interprets True/False values to parameters as string. This won't change due to backwards compatibility. 

By importing task from boolfab, such values will be passed to your function as booleans instead.

```
from boolfab import task
```

In addition some misc extra functions are also included in boolfab:

```
from boolfab import extra_utils
```

But there is no need to import or use these if you don't want to.
